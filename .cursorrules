# JobDock Project Rules

## Deployment Rules
When deploying backend to production, ALWAYS use: cd infrastructure; cdk deploy -c env=prod --require-approval never
When deploying frontend to production, ALWAYS use: .\deploy-frontend-prod.ps1
NEVER deploy backend without -c env=prod flag (it defaults to dev)

## Database Migrations
For Database Migrations:
Use the Lambda function instead (no bastion needed):
.\run-migration-lambda.ps1 -Environment prod

## Browser Testing
dont run browser actions unless I tell you
do not browser test unless I tell you. I will do the testing

## Environment
we are in production env

## Windows/PowerShell
Powershell doesnt accept "&&"
use Windows 10 commands

## Documentation
dont write .md files unless you as an AI agent need it. I will not use them myself.
Ignore all .md files unless explicitly referenced.
