================================================================================
WHAT'S BEEN COMPLETED
================================================================================

   - Added support for custom domains with HTTPS certificates
   - Updated CloudFront distribution to handle custom domains
   - All TypeScript compiles successfully

✅ Deployment Automation:
   - Created deploy-production.ps1 (full deployment script)
   - Created deploy-frontend-prod.ps1 (frontend-only updates)
   - Created check-prod-status.ps1 (status checking)
   - Added npm shortcuts: npm run deploy:prod, etc.

✅ Documentation:
   - PRODUCTION-SETUP-GUIDE.txt (comprehensive guide)
   - QUICK-START-PROD.txt (quick reference)
   - This file (deployment summary)

✅ Migration Support:
   - Existing migrate.ps1 works with prod environment
   - All pending migrations ready to deploy

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS - WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
================================================================================

OPTION 1: Deploy WITHOUT Custom Domain (Fastest)
-------------------------------------------------

Just run:
  npm run deploy:prod

When prompted:
  - Press Enter to skip domain
  - Press Enter to skip certificate
  - Type 'y' to confirm AWS deployment
  - Type 'y' to confirm SES setup

Your app will be available at the CloudFront URL (shown at end).
Time: ~15-20 minutes

You can add a custom domain later!


OPTION 2: Deploy WITH Custom Domain
------------------------------------

Pre-requisites:
  1. Create ACM certificate (5-10 min):
     - Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?region=us-east-1
     - Request certificate for your domain
     - Add DNS validation records
     - Wait for "Issued" status
     - Copy the ARN

  2. Update infrastructure/config.ts:
     - Uncomment and set 'domain' field
     - Uncomment and set 'cloudfrontCertificateArn' field
     - Save file

  3. Run deployment:
     npm run deploy:prod

  4. Add DNS CNAME (instructions will be shown):
     - Add CNAME record to your DNS provider
     - Point to CloudFront distribution
     - Wait 5-30 minutes for propagation

Time: ~20-30 minutes (including ACM certificate wait time)


================================================================================
IMPORTANT: VERIFY SES EMAIL
================================================================================

Before or after deployment, verify your sending email in SES:

1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home?region=us-east-1

2. Verify: jordan@westwavecreative.com (or your preferred email)

3. Request production access (to send to any email, not just verified ones)

Without this, your app can't send invoice/quote emails.


================================================================================
RECOMMENDED: SET UP BILLING ALERTS
================================================================================

Avoid surprise charges:

1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/

2. Create a budget with alerts at 80% and 100%

3. Recommended amount: $50-75/month

Expected costs: $50-70/month (mostly NAT Gateway and RDS)


================================================================================
THE DEPLOYMENT COMMAND
================================================================================

When you're ready:

  npm run deploy:prod

The script is interactive and will:
  ✓ Guide you through configuration
  ✓ Check AWS credentials
  ✓ Remind you about SES
  ✓ Deploy all infrastructure
  ✓ Run migrations
  ✓ Build and deploy frontend
  ✓ Show you the URLs and next steps

If anything fails, you can safely re-run the command.


================================================================================
AFTER DEPLOYMENT
================================================================================

Check status:
  npm run check:prod

Test your app:
  1. Visit the URL shown in deployment output
  2. Register a new account
  3. Create a contact, quote, or job
  4. Test features

Future frontend updates:
  npm run deploy:prod:frontend
  (much faster - just uploads new frontend)


================================================================================
FILES CREATED FOR YOU
================================================================================

Scripts:
  ./deploy-production.ps1          - Full deployment
  ./deploy-frontend-prod.ps1       - Frontend only
  ./check-prod-status.ps1          - Status check
  ./migrate.ps1                    - Database migrations (already existed)

Guides:
  ./PRODUCTION-SETUP-GUIDE.txt     - Detailed instructions
  ./QUICK-START-PROD.txt           - Quick reference
  ./DEPLOYMENT-READY.txt           - This file

Configuration:
  ./infrastructure/config.ts       - Updated with prod config
  ./infrastructure/lib/jobdock-stack.ts - Updated with RDS + domain support
  ./package.json                   - Added deployment scripts


================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

If you get errors:

1. "AWS credentials not configured"
   → Run: aws configure
   → Enter your AWS Access Key ID and Secret

2. "Certificate not found"
   → Certificate must be in us-east-1 region
   → Must be in "Issued" status
   → ARN must be correct in config.ts

3. "Permission denied" on scripts
   → Run: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

4. Build errors
   → Run: npm install
   → Run: cd infrastructure; npm install

5. Stack already exists
   → If you previously deployed, that's OK
   → Script will update existing stack


================================================================================
READY TO GO!
================================================================================

You have everything you need to deploy to production.

When you're ready, just run:

  npm run deploy:prod

The script will walk you through the process step by step.

Good luck with your launch! 🚀
